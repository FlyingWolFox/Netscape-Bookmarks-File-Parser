# Netscape Bookmarks File Parser

This is a Parser for the Netscape Bookmarks file format, which generated by browsers 
when exporting bookmarks to html. It parses the file and deliver you an object 
representing the file with the bookmark structure of folders and shortcuts as 
objects too. The folder tree can be navigated by the "." notation.

## Installation

Run in your command line (might need to run as administrator on Windows):
 ```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/FlyingWolFox/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Parser.git
```
To update add the `--upgrade` flag at the end

## How to use

Import the Parser
 ```python
import NetscapeBookmarksFileParser
```
and call `NetscapeBookmarkFile(bookmarks)`, being bookmarks 
the opened file or a string with the content. This will give
you the file automatically parsed in a NetscapeBookmarksFile
object. To not parse automatically use
`NetscapeBookmarkFile(bookmarks, parse_automatically=Flase)`.
To parse, call the `parse_file()` method. To know about the classes
that the parser will work with, see the [wiki Classes section](https://github.com/FlyingWolFox/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Parser/wiki/Code-Documentation#classes) 

## Notice about this parser

Since Netscape Bookmarks File is commonly generated by browsers when exporting
bookmarks in html, the parser will raise an exception if anything is wrong about
the file. This parser was built on top of
[Microsoft's documentation on the Netscape File Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa753582(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
mainly, but also from file examples [here](https://sixtwothree.org/posts/homesteading-a-decades-worth-of-shared-links),
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38029954/parse-a-netscape-style-bookmarks-html-file-into-nested-array),
[here](https://gist.github.com/jgarber623/cdc8e2fa1cbcb6889872),
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netscape-bookmarks) and my own browser exports
(`test\test.html` is one of them).
Some more uncommon attributes and items may not be supported, I tried to support to support
the common ones and some uncommon that may still be used. Look at the
[Attributes Supported](https://github.com/FlyingWolFox/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Parser/wiki/The-Parser#attributes-supported)
and 
[Items Supported](https://github.com/FlyingWolFox/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Parser/wiki/The-Parser#items-supported)
sections in the wiki. If you want to know more about how a file has to be accepted by te parser look at the

## About legacy support

Due to the Netscape Bookmark file format not having an official standard, many things
of this parser was got by file examples in the internet (see the [Nestcape Bookmarks File format](https://github.com/FlyingWolFox/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Parser/wiki/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Format)
and [The parser](https://github.com/FlyingWolFox/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Parser/wiki/The-Parser)
in the wiki).
This has legacy support for some types of items that aren't in use today. These are:
- Feed: Probably RSS feeds, just some attributes following the Microsoft's Documentation
- Web Slices: "Live bookmarks". They showed a piece of the page you saved. Extinct but in the Microsoft's Documentation.
If you want more details look at the [Legacy section](https://github.com/FlyingWolFox/Netscape-Bookmarks-File-Parser/wiki/The-Parser#about-legacybasic-support)

## Future plans:
- Create a branch that uses normal classes instead of data classes, for support in
earlier versions of Python
